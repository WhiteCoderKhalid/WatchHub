⌚ WatchHub 
🎯 1. Project Background

WatchHub is a modern, sustainable e-commerce mobile application built with Flutter and powered by Firebase.

It is designed for watch lovers and fashion enthusiasts who want a seamless way to browse, explore, and shop for watches in a beautiful, fast, and reliable app.

WatchHub follows sustainable app development principles:

🧩 Separation of concerns → UI, business logic, and data are neatly separated.

📦 Scalable structure → feature-based folders for easy growth.

🔄 Reusable components → widgets and themes are centralized.

⚡ Performance-first → Firebase + optimized state management.

💡 The goal is to create a long-term maintainable app that small businesses and startups can easily adapt for their e-commerce needs.

🛑 2. Problem Definition

Many e-commerce apps fail because they:

🔗 Mix UI with logic, making them hard to maintain.

🛑 Lack modularity for new features.

🎨 Have inconsistent designs.

🔄 Reuse code poorly.

WatchHub solves these by:

Using a sustainable architecture.

Building reusable widgets (buttons, cards, text fields).

Ensuring a single source of truth for theming.

Centralizing Firebase services.

🎯 3. Objectives

✅ Create a modular and scalable Flutter app.

✅ Implement Firebase authentication & database.

✅ Deliver aesthetic, reusable UI components.

✅ Provide a smooth user experience from splash → checkout.

✅ Maintain sustainable coding practices.

🏛️ 4. System Architecture
🌐 High-Level Flow
User → Views (Screens & Widgets) → Controllers (State Management) 
     → Services (Firebase / APIs) → Models (Data Layer) → Firebase Backend

🔹 Layer Breakdown

View Layer (UI) → Screens & widgets

Controller Layer → Business logic & state management

Service Layer → Firebase Auth, Firestore, API integrations

Model Layer → Data classes (User, Product, Order)

Core/Utils Layer → Theming, constants, helpers
